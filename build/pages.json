The expected data can be split into two parts, the first is required and the second, more complex section is optional.<\/p>\r\n\r\n<h4>Section one - <b>manifests<\/b> object<\/h4>\r\n\r\n<p>This object is composed of a simple list of a pair of values for each manifest, the actual URI for the manifest and an indication on where each manifest is from.
